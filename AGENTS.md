## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

## Project rules

- All app data (notices, events, attendance votes) lives in `src/lib/demo-store.ts`: pure reducer functions + a localStorage-backed `useSyncExternalStore` hook whose server snapshot is the seed — keeps SSR and hydration consistent without any backend.
- Global text size is controlled by the `data-font-size` attribute on `<html>` with rem-based styles, so every element scales together; sizes live in `src/lib/font-size.ts`.
- Clan name, slogan and contact info come from `src/lib/site-config.ts` so the placeholder name can be swapped in one place.
- `xlsx` is loaded with a dynamic `import()` inside the download handler so it never enters the SSR bundle.
- Business rules (text sizes, generation lookup, vote validation/totals, notice ordering) are covered in `src/test/demo-rules.test.ts`; update it when rules change.
